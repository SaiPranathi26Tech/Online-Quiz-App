# 📝 Java Console Quiz App 🎮

## 📘 Overview
This project is a **console-based Quiz Application** developed in Java.  
It allows users to **attempt multiple-choice quiz questions**, checks their answers, and calculates the final score.  

The program provides a simple **menu-driven quiz experience** using **control flow and collections** in Java.

This project is ideal for beginners to practice:
- **Java Loops** and **Conditional Statements**
- **Collections (ArrayList, List)**
- **Scanner** for user input
- **Basic OOP Concepts** (Classes & Objects)

## ✨ Features

### 🔹 Core Functionalities
- **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Each question has 4 options, and the user selects the correct one.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks the number of correct answers and displays the score at the end.
- **Answer Validation**: Provides instant feedback for correct and wrong answers.
- **Explanatory Output**: Displays the correct answer if the user selects the wrong one.

### 🛡️ Input Handling and Safety
- Ensures user answers are validated using **if-else conditions**.
- Uses **control flow and loops** to display multiple questions in sequence.
- Avoids crashes with simple **integer-based input handling**.
